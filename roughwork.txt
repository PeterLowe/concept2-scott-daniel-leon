Elevator pitch 
Describe your game in 30 seconds or less
Assassins Creed but instead of the protagonist projecting their mind to the past, they project their mind to the future to stop the templars from taking control over the time space continuum.
You sabotage, infiltrate, and assassinate top secret targets in space stations, on planet surfaces, and in the vast emptiness of space itself. Make use of jetpacks, active camouflage technology, railguns, and solid-light blades to find the best way to take out your targets, and save humanity from the evil plans of your foes.
